# Audit Logging

> **Architecture overview.** This document covers *what* to audit and how the pieces fit together.

Audit trails are for security-sensitive and business-critical actions. They are not a replacement
for access logs, metrics, traces, or event logs.

## What To Audit

Audit these actions when they are implemented:

- admin changes;
- role, permission, membership, and scope changes;
- critical state transitions;
- manual overrides;
- security-sensitive actions;
- rate-limit policy changes;
- critical configuration changes.

Do not persist every normal successful `GET` request as an audit event.

## Event Shape

The common audit foundation records:

- actor type and actor ID;
- tenant/organisation ID and branch ID;
- action;
- resource type and resource ID;
- outcome and severity;
- reason/comment;
- before/after state summaries;
- metadata (including source module, command name, and external system reference);
- request/correlation ID;
- source IP and user agent;
- timestamp.

Redaction is enforced structurally, not by convention: `AuditService.record(...)` redacts
metadata, before, and after before an event reaches its repository. Do not store passwords,
bearer tokens, session cookies, API keys, raw authorization headers, or sensitive PII in audit
metadata regardless — see [audit logging](../security/audit-logging.md) for the full redaction
policy, the seven `AuditService` methods, and the query service.

## Current Adapter

`AuditService` writes to an `AuditEventRepository` port. `JooqAuditEventRepository` is the durable
adapter, backed by the append-only `audit_event` table; the logging-only repository in
`AuditConfiguration` is a `@ConditionalOnMissingBean` fallback used only if no durable adapter is
registered. Domain modules call the application-level audit service directly — that is the only
mechanism; there is no annotation-driven alternative.

## Request Correlation

`HttpAccessLogFilter` preserves inbound `X-Request-Id` or generates one. It returns the header to
clients and stores `requestId` in MDC for request logs. `ActiveOrganisationContextFilter`
separately installs `RequestContexts`, which carries tenant/branch/actor/correlation/user-agent
for the audit adapter to fall back on when a caller does not supply them explicitly.
